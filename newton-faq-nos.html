			<h3 id="IIIA">A. System Versions</h3>

			<h4 id="IIIA1">1. What are the different versions of Newton OS?</h4>

			<p>The Newton OS is burned into the ROM of each device, therefore the version depends on which model of Newton you have.</p>

			<p>Refer to the <a href="newton-faw-hardware.html#IIA1e">Specification differences between models</a> section for more information.</p>

			<p>System updates can be applied to the Newton OS via software patches.</p>

			<h4 id="IIIA2">2. What system updates are available for my Newton?</h4>

			<p>System updates are Newton installer packages which auto-remove themselves after running. All updates include a version checking mechanism, so you cannot damage your Newton by installing the wrong update. It simply won’t install.</p>

			<p>See the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991126001131/http://til.info.apple.com/techinfo.nsf/artnum/n19526">Newton OS: Versions &amp; Updates</a> support document for additional information.</p>

			<h4 id="IIIA2e">e. What is the update numbering system?</h4>

			<p>A six-digit update numbering system was introduced with Newton OS 1.3 to alleviate some of the confusion with previous method of numbering. Adding to the confusion was the fact that the earlier ROM came in 1.0 and 1.1 releases. You can see this for yourself using this handy chart comparing ROM and update versions.</p>

			<p><strong>ROM Version Numbering Comparison</strong></p>

			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>ROM Version</th>
						<th>1.0</th>
						<th>1.1</th>

				<tbody>

			</table>

			<p>This means the 1.02 update for the 1.0 ROM is equivalent to the 1.1.0 ROM, but the 1.05 update for the 1.0 ROM is more recent than the 1.1.1 update for the 1.1 ROM. Simple, right?</p>

			<p>Here’s some background from Walter Smith:</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>“The numbering system originated as a response to customer irrationality. :-) Because each patch applies to a single ROM image, there are multiple patches that produce the same end result. The exact numbers may be off, but let’s say the Original MessagePad had version 1.0 software, then the MessagePad 100 came out with version 1.1. We released an update for the Original MessagePad that brought it up to date, and gave it version 1.01.</p>

				<p>The problem here is that even though 1.01 and 1.1 are functionally equivalent, people with an Original MessagePad were unhappy because their version number was lower. There was lots of misinformation floating around about “upgrading” 1.01 to 1.1, meaningless though that actually was. It got even worse when 1.1 was patched, so you had 1.03 vs. 1.12.</p>

				<p>To address this, we had to distinguish between the actual version number that tells tech support what software the customer has and the end-user version number that tells the customer what functionality they have. The six-digit number is unique to a particular update (software version), and the x.y number indicates what functionality you get when the update is applied (end-user version).</p>

				<p>Unfortunately, some customers are a little too smart to fall for that, so there’s still all sorts of consternation over the supposedly meaningless system update numbers.</p>

				<p>The actual scheme is some combination of the ROM version the update applies to and the date the patch was generated. I don’t remember the details.”</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>The following is Paul Guyot’s interpretation of the six-digit numbering system, partially based on Henry Cate’s reply to Walter Smith’s original post. Both Henry and Walter worked on the Newton engineering team at Apple.</p>

				<li>Third digit:
					<ul>
						<li>The last digit of the year. <sup><a href="#IIIA2e-8">8</a></sup></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Fourth through sixth digits:
					<ul>
						<li>The day of the year that the package was created.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Eckhart Köppen’s Year 2010 upgrade numbering system works like this:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>First digit:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>5</strong> MessagePad 120/130</li>
						<li><strong>7</strong> MessagePad 2000/2100/eMate 300</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Second digit:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>1</strong> MessagePad</li>
						<li><strong>3</strong> eMate 300</li>
						<li><strong>4</strong> MessagePad (German)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Third digit:
					<ul>
						<li>The number of years after 1990. <sup><a href="#IIIA2e-8">8</a></sup></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Fourth through sixth digits:
					<ul>
						<li>The day of the year that the package was created.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p id="IIIA2e-8"><sup>8</sup> Since the third digit indicates the last digit of the year, this assumes that the numbers 0 through 9 represent the years 1990 through 1999. Since the Newton is still around and viable, how do we represent the years after 1999? With the 710031 update, Paul Guyot coded year 2000 with a 0. However, this makes the 710031 upgrade a lower number than the older 717260 upgrade, which is a bit confusing. Avi Drissman suggested that the years 2000 through 2009 be represented as ‘A’ through ‘J’ instead. This is what Eckhart Köppen did with the 71J059, 74J185, and 73J186 updates, but threw it all out the window again with the final 711000 update.</p>

			<h3 id="IIIB">B. Using Newton OS</h3>

			<h4 id="IIIB1">1. How do I find the Newton’s built-in Help Book?</h4>

			<p>Tap the “i” button in the lower left hand corner of the screen, and then select “Help”. This Help Book is accessible from within all built-in applications. Some third-party programs can also access the built-in Help Book or their own application-specific help files via the “i” button.</p>

			<p>You can also tap the “How Do I?” button in the Assist Drawer (Newton OS 2.x only) or tap one of the icons in the “Help” folder of the Extras Drawer.</p>

			<h4 id="IIIB2">2. What are the different ways to reset a Newton?</h4>

			<p>First of all, pressing the power button does not “reset” or “reboot” a Newton.</p>
			
			<p>In fact, it isn’t really a power button in the first place, it’s more of a “put me to sleep” and “wake me back up” button. Unlike other computers, a Newton device is never completely powered off. It’s a suspended state where the device is still able to receive beams, faxes, or wake up automatically.</p>

			<p>There are a number of ways to reset or reboot a Newton device.</p>
			
			<p>Some are described in the Apple Support article <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020221185237/http://karchive.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=17908">Newton MessagePad: Different Types of Reset</a>.</p>

			<h5 id="IIIB2a">a. Soft Reset</h5>

			<p>The soft reset is the most straightforward method. Press the reset button on the back of your Newton device.</p>
			
			<p>Several software packages have the ability to perform a soft reset as well.</p>

			<p>This type of reset is useful if a Newton device becomes sluggish or runs out of heap memory.</p>

			<p>No data is lost during a soft reset.</p>

			<h5 id="IIIB2b">b. Deep Reset</h5>

			<p>The deep reset is similar to a soft reset, but works at a slightly lower level in the operating system. Press the reset button on the back of the Newton device and hold it down for approximately 20 seconds, until you hear a chime.</p>
			
			<p>This type of reset is useful when there’s a problem with powering your Newton device or when a soft reset did not solve a particular problem.</p>

			<p>No data is lost during a deep reset.</p>

			<h5 id="IIIB2c">c. Reset With Extensions Off</h5>

			<p>A reset with extensions off allows you to reboot your Newton device without loading any previously installed packages. The effect is similar to freezing all installed packages and returning the Newton to a “from the factory” state.</p>
			
			<p>You may want to stop packages from activating when inserting a storage card or rebooting your Newton device when there’s a conflict between packages, a package or soup has become corrupt, or you need to maximize the amount of heap memory. With no packages activated, your device will be able to utilize the maximum amount of available heap memory.</p>

			<p>To perform a reset with extensions off, press the reset button on the back of the Newton and then flip the Newton over so the screen is facing you. Immediately tap and hold the pen (or your fingernail) halfway down the left edge of the screen, about a centimeter from the bezel. Keep holding until a dialog box appears asking if you’d like to activate packages on the store “Internal”. Tap “No”.</p>

			<p>If you have any PC cards installed, return the pen (or your fingernail) to the left edge and continue holding it down. You’ll see the same dialog box for each card that is installed. Tap “No”.<p>

			<p>Once this procedure is complete, your Newton device will not have any activated packages. You can now delete the corrupted or conflicting packages from the device.</p>

			<p>No data is lost during a reset with extension off.</p>
			
			<p>However, if you have a third-party application set as the backdrop, it will be replaced with the Notepad application.</p>

			<h5 id="IIIB2d">d. MessagePad 2000/2100 Power Drain Reset</h5>

			<p>MessagePad 2000 and MessagePad 2100 devices have a special type of reset which solves many issues pertaining specifically to these devices. Remove all batteries, cards, and disconnect the power adapter. Let the Newton device sit for several hours until the internal super capacitor is discharged. The super capacitor acts like a backup battery. Put in the batteries, plug in the power adapter, and press the reset button.</p>

			<p>No data is lost during a power drain reset.</p>

			<h5 id="IIIB2e">e. Hard Reset (Brain Wipe)</h5>

			<p>A hard reset is a last resort and is nicknamed “brain wipe” for a reasons. This method <strong>will erase everything on your Newton device</strong> and return it to its original factory settings.</p>
			
			<p>This type of reset is useful if you are experiencing major soup corruption or are selling the device and wish to remove all personal data.</p>

			<p>Before you perform a hard reset, remove all cards from the Newton device. Leaving a memory card in the device may damage the card.</p>

			<p>It is recommended that you perform a full backup of your device prior to a hard reset. After the hard reset, you can then restore you data from the backup.</p>
			
			<p>To perform a hard reset, press the reset button while holding down the power switch. You will be presented with a dialog box asking “Do you want to erase data completely”. Tap “Yes” if you want to perform the hard reset and erase everything on the Newton. You will be asked to confirm your selection, and then all data will be erased.</p>

			<p>Performing a backup, hard reset, and restore cycle will defragment storage and potentially speed up your Newton device.</p>
			
			<p>See also: <a href="#IIID1">How is storage space calculated?</a></p>

			<h5 id="IIIB2f">f. Cold Boot</h5>

			<p>A cold boot only applies to the Original MessagePad and MessagePad 1x0 models. <sup><a href="#IIIB2f-10">10</a></sup></p>

			<p>This method erases all data, installed packages, any System Update that has been installed, and return the device to its original factory settings
			
			<p>It is recommended that you perform a full backup of your device prior to a cold boot. After the cold boot, you can then restore you data from the backup.</p>

			<p>There are two ways to perform a cold boot:</p>

			<p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>

			<ul>
				<li>Disconnect the power adapter.</li>
				<li>Remove the main batteries.</li>
				<li>Remove the backup battery.</li>
				<li>Hold the power switch down for 5 seconds.</li>
				<li>Release the power switch.</li>
				<li>Repeat steps 4 and 5 four more times.</li>
			</ul>

			<p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>

			<ul>
				<li>Disconnect the power adapter.</li>
				<li>Remove the main batteries.</li>
				<li>Remove the backup battery.</li>
				<li>Let the Apple MessagePad sit for at least 15 minutes.</li>
			</ul>

			<p id="IIIB2f-10"><sup>10</sup> On MessagePad 120 devices, no data is lost since data is stored in the internal non-volatile Flash RAM. Also on MessagePad 120 devices, a cold boot resets the power manager. Pen alignment will be required, as will setting the date, time, time zone, and other preferences.</p>

			<h4 id="IIIB3">3. How do I transfer data to and from a Newton?</h4>

			<h5 id="IIIB3a">a. What are the various ways to input data on the Newton?</h5>

			<p>There are several methods of entering data on a Newton Device.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Handwriting recognition
					<ul>
						<li>Printed text recognition using a pen</li>
						<li>Cursive text recognition using a pen</li>
						<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051220043204/http://www.kallisys.com/newton/dicts_and_kits/en">Dictionaries and Foreign Kits</a> by Paul Guyot provide improved recognition for non-English languages.</li>

				<li>Desktop or laptop keyboard via a <a href="#IIIB3e">terminal emulator</a></li>
			</ul>

			<h5 id="IIIB3b">b. How do I transfer data between my Newton and another computer?</h5>

			<p>There are several methods of transferring data between a Newton device and another computer.</p>

			<p>These can include:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Serial connection</li>
				<li>Ethernet or wireless network connection</li>
				<li>Swapping storage cards between Newton devices</li>
				<li>Beaming between Newton devices</li>
				<li>Email</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The model of Newton and what accessories are available for that device will determine which methods are applicable.</p>

			<p>Email is a simple, system-wide means to import and export text. It is also possible to export packages using email, although your mileage may vary.</p>

			<p>Ben Truesdale’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080215200930/http://newted.dyndns.org/users/1f2frfbf/answers.html">Newton Connection FAQ</a> contains additional information regarding transferring and synchronizing data.</p>

			<p>See also: <a href="#IIIB3c">Can I use infrared to transfer data?</a></p>

			<h5 id="IIIB3c">c. Can I use infrared to transfer data?</h5>

			<p>You can transfer individual items such as name cards, notes, and packages between Newton devices using infrared (also known as beaming). Transferring data to another computer using infrared is not supported in Apple’s software, such as <a href="newton-faq-software.html#VB1d">Newton Connection Utilities</a>. However, this is possible using third-party software.</p>

			<p>You can use a terminal emulator and Steve Weyer’s <a href="https://communicrossings.com/html/newton/sloup.htm">Sloup</a> to communicate using the <a href="https://communicrossings.com/html/newton/sloup/connect.htm#IrDA">IrDA</a> infrared protocol.</p>

			<p>Kieran Miller put together a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110105021720/http://web.ukonline.co.uk/kieran.miller/newton/irda.html">Newton IrDA Connection</a> page discussing this issue.</p>

			<p>You can also use Thomas Tempelmann’s <a href="http://www.tempel.org/newton/#DILplugin">Newton Data Browser</a> to connect to the Dock application on a MessagePad 2000, MessagePad 2100, or eMate 300. Note that IrDA communication only works under Classic Mac OS (PPC).</p>

			<h5 id="IIIB3d">d. How do I synchronize data between my Newton and another computer?</h5>

			<p>Most software for synchronizing data was originally designed to work with now obsolete operating systems and applications. That being said, it’s still technically possible to synchronize data between a Newton device and another computer.</p>

			<p>Ben Truesdale’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080215200930/http://newted.dyndns.org/users/1f2frfbf/answers.html">Newton Connection FAQ</a> contains additional information regarding transferring and synchronizing data.</p>

			<p>See also: <a href="newton-faq-software.html#VH2">What software can be used to synchronize data with other applications?</a></p>

			<h5 id="IIIB3e">e. Can I use a terminal emulator to transfer data?</h5>

			<p>Yes. Refer to the list of <a href="newton-faq-software.html#VD2f">Terminal Emulation</a> software which can connect via terminal protocols.</p>

			<h5 id="IIIB3f">f. How do I transfer data between my Newton and another PDA?</h5>

			<p><a href="http://www.smartdogsw.com/backtalk/">BackTalk</a> by SmartDog Software offers one of the easiest ways to transfer data between a device running Newton OS 2.1 and a Palm device or other PDA that uses IrDA.</p>

			<p>You can also transfer data between a Newton OS 2.x device and a Palm device using <a href="newton-faq-software.html#VB1d">Newton Connection Utilities</a> for Mac OS and synchronizing the data with Claris Organizer or Palm Desktop.</p>

			<h5 id="IIIB3g">g. How do I connect a Newton using ethernet?</h5>

			<p>Ethernet only works between devices running Newton OS 2.1 and Mac OS.</p>

			<p>Since the Windows version of Apple’s connection utilities do not support AppleTalk, one workaround is to run the <a href="https://basilisk.cebix.net/">Basilisk II</a> Mac OS emulator on the Windows computer.</p>

			<p>A <a href="http://www.unna.org/unna/development/NewtonDev/macos755-boot.zip">disk image</a> with Newton Connection Utilities pre-installed for Basilisk II is available on UNNA.</p>

			<p>To connect using ethernet:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Make sure your ethernet card is supported. Check the list of cards on Victor Rehorst’s <a href="http://old.chuma.org/newton/ethernet/">Ethernet Information</a> page.</li>
				<li>Install the Newton Internet Enabler (NIE) 2.0 Newton Devices package.</li>
				<li>Install the ethernet package for your card.</li>
				<li>Reboot your Newton device by pressing the reset button. (This is not required, but it’s a good idea.)</li>
				<li>Insert the ethernet card.</li>
				<li>If a card slip appears on screen, the card has been recognized. If not, then the card is either damaged or not compatible.</li>
				<li>On the Newton, go to Prefs &gt; AppleTalk, choose to Connect via EtherTalk, and then choose your ethernet card.</li>
				<li>On the Mac, in the AppleTalk control panel, choose connect via EtherTalk (instructions may vary depending on your Mac OS version)</li>
				<li>Connect the Newton and a Mac with ethernet cable through a hub, or use a special ethernet crossover cable (ask your local computer shop)</li>
				<li>Launch <a href="newton-faq-software.html#VB1d">Newton Connection Utilities</a> on the Mac. In Preferences, make sure that only AppleTalk is selected as a connection option. (This is also not required, but again it’s a good idea.)</li>
				<li>Tap Dock on the Newton. Choose to connect via AppleTalk and browse for your Mac. Newton Connection Utilities must be running on the Mac. Select your computer when it’s name appears.</li>
				<li>You should now be connected.</li>

			<h4 id="IIIB7">7. How do I take screenshots?</h4>

			<p>There are several ways to take a screenshot of the screen on a Newton device.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://newtonresearch.org/connection/">Newton Connection for Mac OS X</a> (NCX) by Simon Bell</li>
				<li><a href="http://www.unna.org/view.php?/apple/development/NTK/macntk">Newton Toolkit</a> (NTK) places the screenshot on the clipboard of the host computer.

			</ul>

			<h4 id="IIIB8">8. How do I find the unique ID of my Newton device?</h4>

			<p>Every MessagePad 2000, MessagePad 2100, and eMate 300 was manufactured with a unique hardware identifier known as a hardware serial number. This identifier is unique to each individual device and is also distinct from the serial number that is printed on the physical unit itself. The hardware serial number is stored in a special chip, the Dallas Semiconductor DS2401 Serial Number ROM. If the motherboard of the device is replaced, the hardware serial number will change as well.</p>

			<p>Although sometimes referred to as a “Newton ID”, the hardware serial number should not be confused with Adam Tow’s <a href="https://tow.com/projects/newton/">NewtonID</a> utility, listed below as one of the ways to view the serial number.</p>

			<h4 id="IIIB9">9. Are there any easter eggs in Newton OS?</h4>

			<p>There are plenty of easter eggs hidden in the Newton OS. Some of the best known easter eggs are:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Eclipse</li>
				<li>Egg Freckles</li>
				<li>Groom Lake</li>
				<li>Neat Bong</li>
				<li>Rosetta! Rosetta! Rosetta!</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Here are some resources for easter eggs and methods of activating them. Note that many easter eggs are specific to certain versions or releases of Newton OS.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Oliver Fross’ <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090215012820/http://oof.org/newton/">List of Newton Easter Eggs</a></li>

				<li>Grant Hutchinson posted a video that demonstrates the <a href="https://vimeo.com/331625488">Neat Bong Assist</a> easter egg.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4 id="IIIB10">10. Are there any viruses that affect Newton OS?</h4>

			<p>No.</p>

			<p>However, as Paul Guyot explained on NewtonTalk several years ago, <a href="http://newtontalk.net/archive/newtontalk/2002-May/1984.html">it’s certainly possible in theory</a>.</p>

			<p>In a similar theoretical vein, developer Bill Kearney described how he and Greg Christie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030515210447/http://www.ideaspace.net/users/wkearney/archives/000122.html">created a hack</a> that could execute code when a user viewed an In Box item.</p>

			<p>By the way, this is not the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100116234515/http://troika.uk.com/newtonvirus">Newton Virus</a> you’re looking for.</p>

			<h4 id="IIIB11">11. How do I freeze a package?</h4>

			<p>When you “freeze” a package, you are selectively deactivating it and any functionality provided by the package is disabled. When a package is “frozen” it does not use any heap memory, although it still takes up storage room. The opposite of “freezing” a package is “thawing” or reactivating it.</p>

			<p>There are a number of utilities that enable freezing:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.unna.org/view.php?/utilites/system_enhancements/Extra-Extras1.3">Extra Extras</a> by Brian Sulcer</li>
				<li><a href="http://www.standalone.com/MessagePad/FreezeU/">Freeze Utilities</a> by Stand Alone (Also available from <a href="http://www.unna.org/view.php?/utilites/system_enhancements/FreezeUtils">UNNA</a>)</li>
				<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030424101757/http://www.newts.com/newton/">NewtCase</a> by Innovative Computer Solutions (Also available from <a href="http://www.unna.org/view.php?/utilites/NewtCase">UNNA</a>)</li>
				<li><a href="http://www.softwarebueromueller.de/englisch/newton/optionen/">SBM Options</a> by Softwarebüro Müller (Also available from <a href="http://www.unna.org/view.php?/utilites/SBMOptions">UNNA</a>)</li>
			</ul>

			<h4 id="IIIB12">12. How do I delete a package?</h4>

			<p>There are two different ways to delete packages from the Extras Drawer.</p>

			<p>If you are in overview mode (list view), tap the checkbox beside the package name, and then select “Delete” from the routing picker.</p>

			<p>If you are in icon mode, tap and hold a package icon until you hear a “squeak” sound, drag over the icon until it is highlighted, and then select “Delete” from the routing picker. You can also simply “scrub” or “zig-zag” over the package icon to delete it. This works the same way as when you are scrubbing out or deleting text.</p>

			<h4 id="IIIB13">13. Why do free space and used space not add up to the size of the internal store or storage card?</h4>

			<p>See: <a href="#IIID1">How is storage space calculated?</a></p>

			<h4 id="IIIB14">14. Why do the internal store or storage card report they are full when there is still free space?</h4>

			<h4 id="IIIB15">15. Does fragmented storage slow down my Newton?</h4>

			<p>See: <a href="#IIID1">How is storage space calculated?</a></p>

			<h4 id="IIIB16">16. What is the maximum size of a Notepad item?</h4>

			<p>Notes, outlines, and lists created in the Notepad application have a maximum size of 8 KB. However, this can be increased to 32 KB using Standalone Software’s <a href="https://www.standalone.com/MessagePad/BigNotes/">Big Notes</a> package.<p>

			<p>Big Notes for Newton OS 2.0 is available from <a href="http://www.unna.org/view.php?/utilites/notes_enhancements/BigNotes">UNNA</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://standalone.com/newtonos/bignotes/*">Internet Archive</a>.<p>

			<p>Big Notes for Newton OS 1.3 is available from <a href="http://mirrors.unna.org/ftp.newted.org/NOS1.x/Utilities/BigNotes%201.01/">UNNA</a>.</p>

			<h4 id="IIIB17">17. How do I remove or bypass the PIN code?</h4>

			<p>There are multiple ways to remove or bypass the Personal Identification Number (PIN) code or password that has been set on a Newton device.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="newton-faq-nos.html#IIIB2e">Hard Reset</a>
				<p>The PIN can be removed by performing a Hard Reset (or “Brain Wipe”). A hard reset will erase everything on the Newton device, returning it to the original factory settings. This method should only be used if you do not need to save any of the data or packages stored on the device.</p></li>
				<li><a href="http://www.unna.org/view.php?/utilites/BatteringRamPro">Battering Ram Pro</a>
				<p>Battering Ram Pro is a software package that you install on a storage card. When the card is inserted into a Newton device, it activates automatically and then proceeds to use brute force to crack the PIN. This method does not erase any data or packages on the Newton device.</p></li>
				<li><a href="https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/net.mit.edu/software/newton/utilities/NEWTON-U/">NewtonUnlock</a>
				<p>NewtonUnlock is small program created by Jeremy Wyld that works similar to Battering Ram Pro. You install the package on a PC storage card and insert it into your Newton device. When the package activates, it bypasses the PIN automatically. Once you are able to access the Newton, tap on NewtonUnlock in the Extras Drawer to remove the PIN entirely. More information can be found in the <a href="https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/net.mit.edu/software/newton/utilities/NEWTON-U/README.TXT">Read Me</a>.</p>
				<p>NewtonUnlock is available from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001007032009/http://download.planetnewton.com/download/util/newtonunlock-2.1.zip">Internet Archive</a>, <a href="https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/net.mit.edu/software/newton/utilities/NEWTON-U/">MIT Student’s Portal</a>, and <a href="http://mirrors.unna.org/download.planetnewton.com/download/util/newtonunlock-2.1.zip">UNNA</a>.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h4 id="IIIB18">18. Does Newton OS support SSL?</h4>

				<p>Sort of.</p>
				<p>Newton OS does not natively support SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) for secure communication with internet services such as websites and email.</p>
				<p>However, Paul Guyot created a Newton OS version of <a href="https://github.com/pguyot/mbedtls-NewtonOS">Mbed TLS</a>, allowing third-party applications to use SSL. As an example, installing Guyot’s <a href="https://github.com/pguyot/mbedtls-NewtonOS/releases/tag/v2.6.16">MailVSSLPatch.pkg</a> on a Newton device enables access to IMAPS mail services within Simon Bell’s <a href="http://newtonresearch.org/mailv/">Mail V</a>.</p>
				<p>This patch requires Newton OS 2.1 and Newton Internet Enabler 2.0.</p>

			<hr>

			<h3 id="IIIC">C. Troubleshooting</h3>

			<h4 id="IIIC1">1. Is the Newton Y2K compliant?</h4>

			<p>Apparently so, according to this Apple Support article: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020102183149/https://karchive.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=30338">Newton OS: Year 2000 (Y2K) Compliance</a></p>

			<p>However, there are other date and time related problems inherent in Newton OS.</p>

			<p>The first to be documented and addressed is the <a href="https://40hz.org/Pages/newton/hacking/newton-year-2010-problem/">Year 2010 Problem</a>, which prevents certain Newton devices from handling dates beyond January 5th, 2010.</p>

			<p>See: <a href="#IIIC2j">Why does the date always reset on my Newton?</a></p>

			<h4 id="IIIC2">2. Are there known bugs in the Newton OS?</h4>

			<p>There are several known bugs.</p>

			<h5 id="IIIC2a">a. What is the -10061 error?</h5>

			<p>This error only occurs on devices with 4 MB DRAM memory, specifically MessagePad 2100, upgraded MessagePad 2000, and upgraded eMate devices.</p>

			<p>Information regarding this error can be found in Frank Wegener’s article <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040205044508/http://home.k-town.de/~oehl/newton/10061.html">What Newton OS Error -10061 really is</a> — translated by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010517003421/http://home.k-town.de/~oehl/">George Oehl</a>.</p>

			<p>The following patches and fixes are available:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.drissman.com/avi/newton/61MemoryFix/">’61 Memory Fix</a> by Avi Drissman</li>
				<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130105015929/http://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/~clli/syspatch.html">SysPatch</a> by Richard Li. This patch prevents the -10061 error by scanning activate packages on a regular schedules and when the device is powered off.</li>
				<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000308144639/http://resources.pdadash.com/newtund/NU/extras.shtml">Auto 10061 Fix</a> by Don Vollum</li>
				<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991111214630/http://home.t-online.de/home/Alessandro.Soldo/NU_10061.html">-10061</a> by Alessandro Soldo. This utility automatically pops up offering the choice to reboot the Newton or fix the -10061 error.</li>
				<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100106071321/http://www.saryo.org/basuke/heaven-or-hell/index.html">Heaven or Hell</a> by Yosuke “Basuke” Suzuki. This utility fixes the -10061 error manually or automatically while the Newton device is idle, or when being powered on or off.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Since these fixes take different approaches to the -10061 problem, there is generally no issue with installing several of the packages on the same device.</p>

			<h5 id="IIIC2b">b. What is the Dates/Find bug?</h5>

			<p>This bug only occurs on devices running Newton OS 2.1. To recreate the bug, open up the Date Book application. Tap “Find” and search for anything that will be found in your dates, for example the letter “e”. From the list of results, select several items. When you try to print, fax, or even preview these items, the process will fail.</p>

			<p>This bug has been fixed in the <a href="#IIIA4d">710031 update</a> for MesssagePad 2000 (US) and MessagePad 2100 (US) devices.</p>

			<p>Avi Drissman’s <a href="http://www.drissman.com/avi/newton/DatesFindBugfix/">Dates/Find Bugfix</a> package also addresses this issue.</p>

			<h5 id="IIIC2c">c. Why do items written or drawn on the screen disappear?</h5>

			<p>This is a known bug and is difficult to replicate. As far as we know, this issue was never addressed by Apple, but may have something to do with the “jaggies”.</p>

			<p>See also: <a href="newton-faq-hardware.html#IIC6g">How do I fix the pen input on my MessagePad 2000/2100?</a></p>

			<h5 id="IIIC2d">d. Why does the amount of free memory decrease when performing a find in Newton Works?</h5>

			<p>This is a bug in Newton OS 2.1, related to the <code>protoTXViewFinder.FindString</code> method found in the ROM. Paul Guyot created a package called <a href="http://www.kallisys.com/files/newton/Patches/NewtWorksFix.zip">NewtWorks Fix</a> to address this issue.</p>

			<h5 id="IIIC2e">e. What is the -16022 error when I use my modem?</h5>

			<p>The -10582 error indicates that an operation has failed due to a missing resource. In this case, there is a bug in Newton OS 2.1 where the system is unable to automatically detect which slot a modem card is inserted into. This error only affects MessagePad 2000 and MessagePad 2100 devices, which have two PCMCIA slots.</p>

			<p>To fix this error, insert the modem into either the bottom or top card slot. Open the Extras Drawer. Open “Prefs”. Tap on “Modem”. Change the “Connect Using” setting from “Default” to either “Bottom PC Card” or “Top PC Card”, depending on the slot you’re using.</p>

			<p>If your Newton is set to display in landscape mode, the card slots will be referred to as “Left PC Card” and “Right PC Card” in the Modem preferences.</p>

			<h5 id="IIIC2f">f. What is the -10582 error when I insert a storage card?</h5>

			<p>The -10582 error is triggered when an ATA-based storage card is inserted and the system cannot locate a “Master Boot Record” on the card. The card is not recognized as a valid store and cannot be used.</p>

			<p>To avoid this error, install Paul Guyot’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080701200025/http://www.kallisys.com/newton/ata/">ATA Support</a> package.</p>

			<p>See also: <a href="newton-faq-hardware.html#IIB1a">What type of storage cards can I use?</a></p>

			<h5 id="IIIC2g">g. Why does the battery in the card need to be replaced when I insert a storage card?</h5>

			<p>This is a known bug. The storage card likely doesn’t even have a battery. Install the latest system patch for your MessagePad 2000 or MessagePad 2100 to correct this error.</p>

			<p>See also: <a href="#IIIA2">What system updates are available for my Newton?</a></p>

			<h5 id="IIIC2h">h. Why doesn’t the new version of my backdrop application appear after installation?</h5>

			<p>This is a known bug discovered by Victor Rehorst.</p>

			<p>Technically, you can have two packages installed with the same “signature” provided that they’re not located on the same store. Normally, the Newton OS will display the second package with a cross through the icon, indicating that the package has not been activated.</p>

			<p>However, the Newton OS does not show the current backdrop application in the Extras Drawer. By extension, the Newton OS will also not show any package with the same signature as the current backdrop application. If you have two packages with the same signature and one is the current backdrop application (and by default, located on the internal store), the other package (located on a storage card) will be hidden.<p>

			<p>The solution is to make another package, such as Notepad or Extras Drawer, the backdrop application. Once you set a different backdrop application, you’ll see both of previously hidden packages.</p>

			<h5 id="IIIC2i">i. Why can’t I change between single and double page Newton Books?</h5>

			<p>There is a bug in some versions of the built-in Newton Book Reader software. When you attempt to change the display of a double page book to single page in the Preferences, the Newton Book Reader will crash.</p>

			<h5 id="IIIC2j">j. Why does the date always reset on my Newton?</h5>

			<p>This is known as the <a href="https://40hz.org/Pages/newton/hacking/newton-year-2010-problem/">Year 2010 Problem</a>.</p>

			<p>Devices running an unpatched version of Newton OS 2.1 cannot handle dates past January 5th, 2010. The bug is located in the NewtonScript interface used by certain time functions and is caused by an integer value overflow.</p>

			<p>Eckhart Köppen created several system updates to correct this bug.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The <a href="https://40hz.org/Pages/newton/patches/patch711000/">711000</a> update for the MessagePad 2000 and MessagePad 2100 (US)</li>
				<li>The <a href="https://40hz.org/Pages/newton/patches/patch74j185/">74J185</a> update for the MessagePad 2100 (German)</li>
				<li>The <a href="https://40hz.org/Pages/newton/patches/patch73j186/">73J186</a> update for the eMate 300</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Avi Drissman created <a href="http://www.drissman.com/avi/newton/Fix2010/">Fix2010</a>, a less comprehensive patch for devices running Newton OS 2.0.</p>

			<h5 id="IIIC2k">j. Why did my Newton suddenly freeze up in January 2025?</h5>

			<p>This is known as the Year 2025 Problem.</p>

			<p>This is a variation of the <a href="https://40hz.org/Pages/newton/hacking/newton-year-2010-problem/">Year 2010 Problem</a>, but in this case it causes devices running Newton OS 2.1 to freeze up after January 4th, 2025. Rather than occurring in NewtonScript like the Y2010 issue, this problem is related to timers in the operating system itself.</p>

			<p>Eckhart Köppen created several system updates to correct this bug.</p>

			<ul>

			<h4 id="IIIC3">3. Why can’t I install packages?</h4>

			<h5 id="IIIC3a">a. Why won’t the package installer recognize a .pkg file?</h5>

			<p>The type and creator of the package file are not set properly. This can cause package files to be unrecognized by a package installer application such as <a href="newton-faq-software.html#VB1c">Newton Package Installer</a> or <a href="newton-faq-software.html#VB1d">Newton Connection Utilities</a>.</p>

			<p>If you are running classic Mac OS, you can use ResEdit to change the the type to <code>pkg&nbsp;</code> (including the trailing space) and the creator to <code>pkgX</code>.</p>

			<p>The <code>pkgX</code> creator designation is associated with the <a href="newton-faq-software.html#VB1c">Newton Package Installer</a> application. Packages can have other creator designations, such as <code>1NCU</code>, which is associated with <a href="newton-faq-software.html#VB1d">Newton Connection Utilities</a>.</p>

			<p>There are also simple utilities which will change the file type and creator, including:</p>

			</ul>

			<p>If you are running Mac OS X or later, the .pkg extension is used by the system. The file extension must be changed to .newtonpkg for Newton packages to be recognized by modern package installers such as <a href="https://newtonresearch.org/connection/">Newton Connection for Mac OS X</a> (NCX).</p>
			
			<p>You can also simple drag and drop any package file regardless of the file extension onto the NCX application window once you have connected to your Newton device.</p>

			<p>Pawel Piotrowski’s <a href="http://applenewton.co.uk/newton-workshop/newton-pkg-for-ncx/">PKG to NewtonPKG</a> Automator script can help with changing package file extensions in a batch.</p>

			<h5 id="IIIC3b">b. Why doesn’t a .pkg file work when downloaded using a Newton web browser?</h5>

			<p>Assuming the package was uploaded to the web server as a binary file, then it’s likely that the server is not providing the correct MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) mapping for the .pkg file extension. The server administrator will need to add a MIME type of <code>application/x-newton-compatible-pkg</code> for the .pkg file extension. The specific method of setting the MIME type will depend on the web server software and platform being used.</p>

			<p>If you are running Mac OS, you can add or adjust the file mapping entry for .pkg extensions using the Internet Config or Internet control panel.</p>

			<h5 id="IIIC3c">c. How do I expand StuffIt archives containing .pkg files?</h5>

			<p>Use a current version of <a href="https://stuffit.com/">StuffIt Expander</a> for your platform or <a href="https://theunarchiver.com">The Unarchiver</a> for Mac OS X.</p>

			<h5 id="IIIC3d">d. Why won’t .pkg files work on my Windows computer?</h5>

			<p>The package may have been corrupted due to incorrect decompression settings.</p>

			<p>If you are using a Windows utility (such as <a href="https://stuffit.com/">StuffIt Expander</a>) to decompress Mac OS archives, the “Convert Text files to Windows format” and “Save Macintosh files in MacBinary format” settings should be set to “Never”.</p>

			<p>If you are unzipping a compressed .pkg file on a PC and it isn’t recognized by the package installer, the file might be MacBinary encoded. You should be able to strip the MacBinary header from the file using Roger Milne’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100916222855/http://roger.trideja.com/newton/pkgstrip.html">Pkg Stripper</a> utility.</p>

			<h4 id="IIIC4">4. Why does the InOut Box always open to Out Box?</h4>

			<p>This is related to an issue with older versions of <a href="https://communicrossings.com/html/newton/newtscape.htm">Newt’s Cape</a> (2.0a and earlier). If you tapped a mailto: link on a web page, it created a message and open it in the Out Box.</p>

			<p>Other software packages may have changed the default In Box setting as well. Steve Weyer’s <a href="https://communicrossings.com/html/newton/newtscape/exs/ioboxfix.htm">InOut Box Fixer Form</a> provides a solution that can be implemented using a soup editor or by running the example directly in the <a href="https://communicrossings.com/html/newton/newtscape.htm">Newt’s Cape</a> application.</p>

			<h4 id="IIIC5">5. Why does the available memory decrease when the Newton is idle?</h4>

			<p>This behaviour is normal in an system that performs automatic memory management, such as Newton OS (and similarly structured programming languages like Smalltalk, Lisp, and Java).</p>

			<p>As the programmatic event loop runs (or is idling), Newton OS creates temporary objects which use bits of memory along the way. When this process reaches a certain threshold, the Newton reclaims memory by locating and discarding objects that are no longer being referenced by other objects. This procedure is also known as “garbage collection”.</p>

			<p>A “leak” happens if the bulk of the unused memory isn’t reclaimed. This may happen if an application holds on to extra data even after its been closed. Memory “leakage” can also happen during soup (the Newton OS database structure) processing when the memory becomes fragmented. Unfortunately, memory fragmentation is one of those bugs that Apple never got around to fixing before the Newton was discontinued.</p>

			<p>See: <a href="#IIIB2c">Reset With Extensions Off</a></p>

			<hr>

			<h3 id="IIID">D. How does Newton OS work?</h3>

			<h4 id="IIID1">1. How is storage space calculated?</h4>

			<p>The Newton OS storage space arithmetic shares with conventional filesystems storage arithmetic its weirdness. However, even if these rules remain a complete mystery for the human minds, they are very different.</p>

			<p>There are actually two values returned by the system:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The used space</li>
				<li>The total space</li>
			</ul>

			<p>When the Extras drawer (or anything else) gives a value of the free space, it is just total minus used.</p>

			<p>One can also compute or find other values, such as the nominal size of a store (what is written on a card or what you will find in the hardware section of the FAQ for the internal store), the sum of the size of all objects that a program can access and other similar things. Beware, don’t mix up system RAM installed and the internal store size.</p>

			<p>See also: <a href="#IIID4">How is the memory organized?</a></p>

			<p>All these values give you an idea of the situation, but you can’t simply add or subtract values, here are a couple of reasons:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The internal flash (4 MB on the MessagePad 2000/2100) is not entirely reserved for the internal store. Part of it contains the system update, the calibration (tablet and temperature) data, etc.</li>
				<li>Newton OS storage system is transactional, which means that to make a change, the system writes a copy and then commits the change. This means that some space is to be reserved for transaction, and if not enough space for the transaction can be found, the transaction fails and the Newton will display the storage full alert.</li>
				<li>Flash chips used are divided in 64 KB blocks that can only be erased at once (individual bits can be muted from one state, say 0, to the other, say 1 — 0 and 1 could be exchanged here, depends on the chips). For some reason, the Newton OS also divides SRAM in 64 KB blocks and consider them just like flash blocks.</li>
				<li>Originally, objects could not be included into more than one block. And in fact, soup entries had to fit one 64 KB block. To have bigger objects, there is a special kind of objects, Large Binary Objects, that are divided into several blocks. If a store is nearly full, a newly large binary object is divided into many blocks. This is what can be called fragmentation.</li>
				<li>A store includes more data than what some software counts as the used space. There is some information on the store (including its name, ID, kind, password (this is partly implemented in the OS, the missing part is the slip to set it/ask for it). The store also can have some information associated to it (see the programmer’s doc for details). And finally, we have the soups. Each soup can have information associated (idem), such as the last time it was backed up, and some information to identify them (name, what is indexed). Data includes the indexes and the entries of course. Finally, a store used size can temporarily include the VBOs.</li>
				<li>Newton OS stores are garbaged collected, which isn’t surprising for a persistent object store. There is a single persistence root for the curious, a special object with an ID that is determined by the system (it is 0x27 for flash stores, another fixed value for Package Store (0 AFAIR) and some variable value for ATA stores).</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Note: Linear and ATA stores follow different calculation methods.</p>

			<p>Probably the most comprehensive source for information is Carsten Lemmen’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151024230720/http://www.mac3.de/sig/newton/memory_cards.html">Memory Cards</a> page. The data relies on speed values taken from the Nick’s Test It utility. While the time spent to do the test is probably the best comparison tool, even if it can change a lot due to various factors including pen input, software installed, etc., the speed given by Nick’s Test It does not mean much.</p>

			<p>Indeed, Nick’s Test It creates a temporary soup (hence with at least an index on the unique ID) and then creates 335 entries with the following frame:</p>

<pre><code>{
     s : “ABC..YZabc...wxABC..YZabc...wxABC..YZabc...wxABC..YZabc...wx”
}</code></pre>

			<p>which is 452 bytes; therefore if we count out the index, and the unique ID slot, we have 148 KB of useful data transferred.</p>

			<p>Additionally, on a flash store, creating an entry actually means creating a transaction, i.e. copying 64 KB of data. So copying 335 entries means much more than 100 KB. I also think that if the store is nearly empty, the 64 KB aren’t copied when possible, hence the much higher value for freshly formatted cards.</p>

			<p>Finally, defragmenting can be done by doing a full backup, erasing all data and restoring the backup. Since backups never hurt, defragmenting cannot hurt. Whether it helps getting some bytes back/improving speed depends on your belief.</p>

			<h4 id="IIID2">2. How are packages compressed?</h4>

			<p>Packages are compressed when loaded on the Newton (i.e. when transfered from another computer). They are uncompressed on the fly when mapped on the Virtual Memory. This may result in a (little) slow down. The Newton OS compresses packages according to a flag called the compression bit. This flag is set by the programmer in NTK (NDE offers the same option). But it can be set on some packages that were not designed to be compressed.</p>

			<p>Moreover, Newton OS 2.x packages also have a fast compression bit. Having it set reduces the compression gain, but it is said to speed up things. I have never felt an important change, however.</p>

			<p>Some packages must not be compressed (as explained in the Newton Formats document) because they need to stay resident. This is very rare, so you may want to compress the uncompressed packages. This can be accomplished on Mac OS using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990428121826/http://www.orient.co.jp/~tmurai/freeware/newton/jfont/newtonfontj.html">PackageFlag Changer</a> by Tomoyoshi Murai.</p>

			<p><a href="http://old.chuma.org/newton/newtpackageflags/">NewtPackageFlags</a> by Victor Rehorst is a Windows utility to manipulate the various package options stored within the header of a Newton package file.</p>

			<p>Jonathan Kipling Knight of Prism Research enabled the compression bit on some common uncompressed packages and made them available to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991012080346/http://homestead.dejanews.com/user.prism2/downloads.html">download</a>.</p>

			<h4 id="IIID3">3. How are processes managed?</h4>

			<p>There are two kinds of processes on the Newton. First, there are lower-level operating system processes (such as handwriting recognition or the NewtonScript interpreter). Such processes are usually written in C++, though some have been written in assembly code. As of Newton OS 2.0, third-party developers can write some (but not all) of their program code in this low-level C++ fashion as well.</p>

			<p>The other kind of process is a “NewtonScript application”. NewtonScript applications are not actually applications — they’re better thought of as plug-ins to the NewtonScript interpreter. Just like Java applications on other platforms, NewtonScript applications can be in a pcode format to be interpreted by the interpreter (slow), or can be compiled directly into machine code. The Newton even has a compiler built-in; it’s possible to use this compiler to build NewtonScript applications directly on the Newton without ever using another computer. Nearly all the icons you see in the Extras Drawer are NewtonScript applications. There’s a lot of NewtonScript stuff in the background too.</p>

			<p>Does the Newton multitask? Yes and no. As we understand it, the Newton’s underlying operating system has a preemptive multithreaded process manager; the inker, handwriting recognition, low-level I/O, and NewtonScript interpreter all run in separate processes. However, NewtonScript “applications” (like the Notepad, or a third-party calculator, or the Button Bar, etc.) are not multitasked in any sense of the term. In fact, they are in essence different functions in the same big computer program hosted by the NewtonScript interpreter. They all share the same memory and run together in a single process. Any one application can hog all the processor power if it wants to. From a user’s perspective, no, the Newton doesn’t have preemptive multitasking. However, when two cards are inserted at the same time, maybe two NS tasks run at the same time.</p>

			<p>The main way that NewtonScript applications “share” processor time is using an <em>event model</em>. Events (keystrokes, taps, incoming serial port information, etc.) are piled up at a low level into an event queue where they await processing by appropriate applications. NewtonScript applications register <em>callback functions</em> to be called when certain events occur that are germane to that application. NewtonScript calls these functions “scripts”. When a callback function has been called and has completed its work, the processor is released from duty and some callback function is called for the next event in the queue. When no events are in the queue, the processor sleeps. Applications may register for timer events which occur periodically (once an hour, week, day, etc.). Applications may also register for “idle” events — if there is no event presently in the queue, the processor every once in a while queues up an “idle” event and hands it off to a registered callback function. This allows applications to do work in the background all by themselves. Besides, since there is only one Event Loop, the system stops when there is nothing to do, awaiting for any event (including a clock change) which will wake it up. This allows the Newton to consume very few power.</p>

			<h4 id="IIID4">4. How is the memory organized?</h4>

			<p>The Newton processor can access memory for 32 bits, i.e. 4 GB. All this memory is not used. There is globally five chunks dedicated to specific tasks:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Page zero is for some interrupts. It cannot be read except when an interrupt occurs.</li>
				<li>The ROM. MessagePad 2000/2100 devices have 8 megs of ROM. It is read only.</li>
				<li>The Patchable Tables. It is a zone in DRAM but locked and updated at startup from the update which is saved into the Internal Store Block 0. It includes tables to elements which are in the ROM at a ROM dependent place. There are other tables which we don’t know how to patch (yet).</li>
				<li>The RAM. The whole memory is divided into heaps, the DRAM is divided into at least two heaps (we are sure that there are two heaps, although there may be more, and programs can create some):
					<ul>
						<li>A large hunk of DRAM of unknown size is reserved to hold the actual computer code and some read-only resources for running C++ and NewtonScript applications. Another chunk of memory, in DRAM, probably about 200K in size on a MessagePad 2000, is where C++ programs and the operating system allocate memory as necessary. This includes the window management and graphics system, handwriting recognition, low-level running of the NewtonScript interpreter, the file system, etc. It also includes the Newton Internet Enabler, which is why for example the MessagePad 2000 will often hang if you open or close windows while running NIE (both need C++ memory, and there isn’t enough to go around). MacinTalk and the sound subsystem also use this space, as do the C++ parts of various third-party applications. These two areas of DRAM are roughly equivalent to a typical computer’s RAM in that they hold the application code and allocated memory state.</li>
						<li>The most famous chunk of memory, the NewtonScript heap or “frames heap”, is where the NewtonScript interpreter manages memory for various NewtonScript applications. On an MessagePad 2000, this space is about 150K in size and resides in DRAM. All NewtonScript applications, including the built-in ones and nearly everything written by third parties, share this memory space when they’re open. Even when closed, some applications hang on to small parts of this memory to “remember” certain things related to process-to-process interaction — for example, Newt’s Cape hangs on to a small chunk of global memory in which is registered all of its plug-ins. NIE also holds on to quite a large chunk of memory to manage its interface to various NewtonScript internet applications. The Newton also maintains a small piece of NewtonScript memory for every unfrozen application, containing pointers to its name and icon, as well as small NewtonScript functions (“scripts”) which get run when the application’s card is removed or installed, or when the application is deleted. The more applications you have unfrozen, the smaller your NewtonScript heap will be.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>A virtual zone where virtual binary objects are stored. This zone contains the activated packages locked there.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The last area of memory is where the Newton’s “File System” (so to speak) is managed. This area consists of internal DRAM on some early units, internal Flash RAM on others, and of course all of the Flash or DRAM on inserted RAM cards. Flash RAM is not useful for the other chunks of memory, because it is far too slow to hold executing computer code or dynamic memory allocation. Flash RAM also can only be accessed in hunks of (16K) memory at a time, similar to a hard disk’s sectors. But Flash RAM is excellent for storing archival information, since it does not require battery backup.</p>

			<p>When the user presses the reset button on a Newton, certain chunks of the DRAM are wiped clean and the system is rebooted. This basically means the RAM which holds the executing computer code, the allocated C++ memory, and the NewtonScript heap. The low-level system areas and the “file system” storage of course remain intact.</p>

			<h4 id="IIID5">5. Does Newton OS have a file system?</h4>

			<p>The Newton does not have a file system per se. It has a shallow database system. The Newton considers its internal store, and each inserted card, as a separate “store” (a volume). On any store may be placed either read/write “soups” (databases), or read-only objects called “packages”.</p>

			<p>Packages are roughly equivalent to application programs, though they may also be storage areas or plug-ins. They consist of bundles of “parts”. A “part” might be a chunk of executable computer code, a set of large binary objects, a read-only embedded soup, etc. Packages can be stored in compressed or uncompressed format on the Newton. They are always uncompressed on desktop and laptop computers.</p>

			<p>A soup is a simple one-table database of “entries” which may be indexed in many ways and over which a variety of queries may be made. Various soups store the Newton’s equivalent of “documents” or “files”. The Newton has a rich set of indexing and querying mechanisms for soups. One important index is the “tags” index. Soup entries may be “tagged” with some user-defined string; applications use these tags to give the illusion of filing entries into “folders”, one folder per user-defined string. This is for example the case when filing programs in the Extras Drawer.</p>

			<p>Soups have an accompanying ID symbol which represents a soup of that “kind”; this ID is assigned to a soup by the application which created it and uses it. For example, Hemlock maintains two soups, each with a different ID. One soup holds Hemlock’s search engines, and the other holds Hemlock’s current query results.</p>

			<p>Soups on different stores may have the same ID, meaning that they are the same kind of soup, just spread out on different cards. When applications access soups, they usually do so by querying and accessing a “union soup” object. From an application’s perspective, union soups merge all the soups of a given ID on different stores into one unified soup for that ID. This happens dynamically; when a user adds or removes cards, the union soup changes automatically, each application is notified, and they update their presentation to the user to reflect this. For example, when the user yanks a card containing a Notepad soup, the appropriate soup entries (hence “notes”) in the Notepad’s union soup automatically disappear, the Notepad is notified, and its display is updated to show that these entries are now gone. It is this general philosophy of treating documents as database entries in a global union soup which is why the Newtons are so graceful at handling multiple cards yanked and inserted while applications are running.</p>

			<p>There are a few global soups which all applications use; the most important one is the “System” Soup, which stores global information for applications, commonly application preferences. When applications are installed they often will insert an entry into this soup to store their preferences, but when they are deleted they very often forget to remove this entry. As a result the System soup grows and grows. Some users have reported a bloated System soup as a key culprit in the “jaggies”, a condition where the Newton cannot properly register the location of the pen.</p>
